Little research exists on how the word very is used differently based on an individual's age, gender, or social class. This study examines how the frequency of the word very has evolved across these groups over time, using data from a corpus of spoken English samples known as the Spoken British National Corpus. A 1994 set and a 2014 set were compared, and the findings showed that the frequency of very grew over time. Individuals 60 and older used"

I have concluded that public relations will be most ethical and have the most value for publics, organizations, and society when the function is involved in the strategic management processes of organizations and is practiced with a symmetrical approach rather than a purely asymmetrical approach.

Deviating from the existing literature, this study develops an alternative approach to a paradox, particularly from a Buddhist perspective. To this end, I conducted a three-month"

Across four studies, we measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Studies 2\u20134) mental fatigue to test our hypotheses. We found that negotiation dyads with"

As a consequence, we have a weak understanding of how globalization and rule of law affect the risk of ethnic war.

Study 2 replicated these results using a different task and also compared the impact of learning and performance goals to dispositional goal orientation. We found that implicit negotiation beliefs, derived from theories of dispositional"

We also argue why such balanced states are likely to be more than just transitory, and why people attempt to rebalance systems rendered imbalanced by a breach. In addition, by examining the balance motive in trust relations, we conjecture about when"

We show that nontelecommuters often perceive unfairness when their coworkers telecommute. However, working in pajamas is not a panacea as telecommuters also perceive unfairness owing to their remoteness. We support our arguments by highlighting representative quotes from employees and managers in four telecommuting organizations."

In two studies, we tested the argument that anticipated happiness initiates an approach goal, leading individuals to promote economic interests. Study 1 revealed that anticipated happiness was positively related to the propensity to initiate a negotiation, mediated by an approach goal. In Study 2, we found that anticipated happiness"

We find that individuals who envy a counterpart are more likely to deceive them than are individuals who do not envy their counterpart. Across both a scenario and a laboratory study, we explore the influence of envy in a negotiation setting. Negotiations represent a domain in which social comparisons are prevalent and deception poses a particularly important concern. In our studies, we induce envy by providing participants with upward social comparison information. We find that"
